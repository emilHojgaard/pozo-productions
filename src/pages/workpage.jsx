      '<div class="space-y-4 text-sm font-light leading-7"><p> <strong class="signpainter text-lg">LA MALA</strong> is a pre-columbian and post-colonial fairy tale of two women, lived through the body of a daughter, revealing the story of a mother. It tells the story of being forced to leave your homeland without knowing why. <em>La Mala</em> is told through broken love stories, tinder dates, tales of crossing borders, of arriving, of being seen as exotic, of being told you are too much, or not enough.</p> <p><strong class="signpainter text-lg">LA MALA</strong> is an homage to all the mothers out there who have left their soil for their child, for a safer future that is yet not here. <em>La Mala</em> is a love letter to my own mother but it also wants to bind all the mothers that have migrated to another country carrying their child, and when they arrive to that country, often find themselves in a position of caring for others. <em>La Mala</em> asks the question: who will take care of them when they fall in-between a welfare system who once upon a time was designed for safety, and now treats them as parasites? How did the carer become a parasite?</p><p>Through storytelling that plays with ghostly presence and dramatic auto-fiction, the performance reveals the multidimensional being by dissecting tired images and projections of the woman and mother figure, from the saint to the sinner.</p><p><strong class="signpainter text-lg">LA MALA</strong> is a solo performance where worlds collide and ultimately merge together. It binds the present with the past by letting the contemporary woman figure; daughter and mother, that has fallen between worlds, to ask for guidance from her ancestors. She listens to the knowledge that is carried through generations in order to find peace and resilience in the current systems of inequality.</p><p>The performance is unfolded through nonlinear narratives that intertwine memory and mythology, intimacy and imagination, fiction and documentation. Through this lens, the choreography explores hybrid identities, entangled temporalities, and emotional excess — using the performing body as a site of transformation through rupture and re-collection of lost memories.</p><p><strong>Premiere:</strong> Autumn Season 2026, MDT, Stockholm</p><p><strong>Following shows:</strong> Dansehallerne, Copenhagen, Date TBC</p></div>',

      '<div class="space-y-4 text-sm font-light leading-7"> <p> <strong>YIELDING</strong> is an immersive performance exploring power, intimacy, and vulnerability through resonance. Two male-coded dancers embody strength and surrendering in a fluid world of emotional tension, collapse, and interdependence. The performance invites audiences into a surreal world where bodies become resonance, time dissolves, and power is constantly negotiated—unravelling the complex tensions between strength and vulnerability, resistance and surrender.</p><p>In <strong>YIELDING</strong>, the performers explore the boundaries of the self and the other, suggesting that our human state is not fixed, but stretchable, fragile, and ever-changing. Their bodies intertwine, dissolve, collapse, and rest into one another—becoming both the battlefield and the sanctuary. The performance pulses with moments of intensity and softness, inviting spectators to witness and feel a landscape where emotional highs and lows reflect our deepest suppressed fears and desires.</p><p><strong>YIELDING</strong> confronts our collective discomfort with intimacy — a discomfort rooted in hegemonic and patriarchal ideas of power. Through touch, pressure, and vulnerability, the dancers challenge these narratives, offering a radical reimagining of masculinity and connection. This is not a dance of domination, but one of transformation — where yielding becomes an act of resistance, and softness a source of strength. </p><p>As the performance unfolds, audiences are drawn into a vibrating world teetering on the edge of collapse. Within this space, interdependence emerges not as weakness, but as a vital force — one that binds, heals, and reshapes us. <strong>YIELDING</strong> is not just something to watch; it\'s something to feel. It offers an invitation to sense, and to reconsider the roles we play with ourselves, with others, and in society. This is dance as dialogue. Dance as disruption. Dance as a visceral, living experience that speaks to our shared humanity.</p><p><strong>CONCEPT & CHOREOGRAPHY:</strong> Escarleth Romo Pozo<br /><strong>DEVELOPED & PERFORMED BY:</strong> Robert Malmborg, Victor Pérez Armero<br /><strong>SOUND DESIGN:</strong> Adde Huumonen<br /><strong>COSTUME:</strong> Erik Annerborn<br /><strong>LIGHT DESIGN:</strong> Jonatan Winbo<br /><strong>CO-PRODUCTIONS:</strong> MDT, Atalante, Dansstationen, Dansehallerne, Life Long Burning – <em>Futures lost and found</em> project supported by the Creative Europe Programme of the European Union<br /><strong>FUNDED BY:</strong> Swedish Art Grant Committee, Augustinus Foundation, William Demant Foundation</p></div>',
